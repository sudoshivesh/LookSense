# LookSense - A Facial Expression Recognition

## Introduction
Employing deep convolutional neural networks, this project seeks to categorize facial expressions into seven distinct emotions. Trained on the FER-2013 dataset, featured at the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), the dataset encompasses 35,887 grayscale images of 48x48 dimensions, each portraying one of seven emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutrality, sadness, and surprise.

## Dependencies
